Analyze the worst-case time complexity of the private member function makeEmpty(BinaryNode* & t) of the binary expression tree. Give the complexity in the form of Big-O.

Complexity Analysis for the fucntion "makeEmpty(BinaryNode* &t)"
The function begins at the leaf nodes of the binary tree. As it makes its way to the root node, 
the function deletes each node in the tree. The time complexity in Big-O notation is O(N).
